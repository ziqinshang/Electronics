#### Theory of Boolean algebra, switching circuits, Venn diagrams; Karnaugh maps; logic and memory systems, design of combinational and sequential switching machines; electronic switching circuits; data coding, storage, transmission; basic design of digital computers.
### Control Systems
#### The concept of feedbacks; modelling of dynamic systems; characteristics of feedback control systems, performance of control systems in time and frequency domains; stability of feedback systems; control system analysis and design. Using root locus and frequency response techniques.
###  Signal Processing
#### Introduction to discrete-time signals and sampled data, linear time-invariant (LTI) systems, frequency response, discrete Fourier transforms, convolution, spectrum analysis, Z-transforms, non-recursive digital filters.
### Image Processing
#### fundamentals of digital image processing, including image representation, histograms, contrast enhancement, geometric operations, registration, digital filtering and segmentation. Emphasis is placed on implementation of algorithms and on practical applications in industry, science and medicine.
